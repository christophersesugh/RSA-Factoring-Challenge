# RSA-Factoring-Challenge
The RSA Factoring Challenge was a challenge put forward by RSA Laboratories on
March 18, 1991 to encourage research into computational number theory and the
practical difficulty of factoring large integers and cracking RSA keys used in
cryptography.
## The mathematics
RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exists prime numbers p and q such that
```
n = p x q
```
### Tasks
- Factorize all the things.


Usage: `factors <file>`
Where `<file>` is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
- RSA Factoring Challenge


RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number `n`, there exist prime numbers `p` and `q` such that `n = p Ã— q`. The problem is to find these two primes, given only `n`.


Usage: `rsa <file>`
